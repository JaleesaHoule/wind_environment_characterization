# wind_environment_characterization
raw data and analysis for paper

This directory will be the home to code for my paper. Tentative structure:

Wind Data Processing 
  -> bin files; another directory link??
  -> processing notebook and python files
  -> HDF files (with lat lons converted to x,y,z for privacy reasons
 
 Data Analysis
  -> spatial code
    -> mention of where to find control tower data 
    -> 10 min chunks dfs??
    -> show processing to get df
  -> temporal code
    -> show process to get df
    -> include fulldf of data
    -> show process to get heatmaps
  -> plots 
    -> spatial plots
    -> temporal plots
    -> statsmodel residuals 
    -> other supplementary figures
