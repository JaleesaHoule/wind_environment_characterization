# wind_environment_characterization

## raw data and analysis for "Near-surface wind variability over spatiotemporal scales relevant to plume tracking insects" (https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0147945)

</br>

This directory will be the home to all data analysis, raw data are hosted via Figshare: https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.21111610. Repository structure:

### Raw Data Processing 
  - Example bin files from data collected on 7/7/21
  - Code: data preprocessing procedure and general time series plotting notebooks
 
### Spatial analysis
  - Data: WRCC control tower data collected from: https://wrcc.dri.edu/cgi-bin/rawMAIN.pl?nvsagh
  - Data: 10 min averaged datasets for spatial regression analysis 
  - Code: data processing to obtain regression datasets and figures

### Temporal analysis
  - Data: datasets for both horizontal and vertical regression analysis 
  - Code: process to get heatmap figures
  - Code: horizontal and vertical regression analysis and figures

### Frequency analysis
  - Code: 10 min averaged PSD for each dataset and corresponding figures
  
### Sensor noise test
  - Data: 30 minutes of sensor data collected from wind tunnel
  - Code: comparison of data collected at different wind speeds along with smoothing parameters
